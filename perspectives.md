### Purpose of this document:
This markdown file is to certain extent a proposal for what to include in this repository. 

### Introduction
After reading the initial file in this repository called <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/data-underground/blob/master/open-data-guidelines.md">"open-data-guidelines.md"</a>, I made some issues <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/data-underground/issues/1">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/data-underground/issues/2">here</a>.

After further evaluation, the thing that was bugging me was that the <a href="https://github.com/softwareunderground/data-underground/blob/master/open-data-guidelines.md">document</a> was written directed at the supplier of a dataset. While that is the obvious place to start, it is worth thinking about a range of personas, multiple use cases, and different possible future states. 

## Brainstorm of Personas, Use-cases, Users, Evolutions of Requirements

### Builders & Maintainers of the website that hosts and presents that data to end-users
These would be the people with the ability to make changes to https://dataunderground.org/dataset.

Some characteristics one could use to describe them that might matter would be:
1. The amount of time they want to / can contribute.
2. The degree to which they choose to accept edits, code, or other types of control from outside the initial group. 
3. Skills, particularly those that affect tech stack. 

### Users
Highest level breakdown of users:
1. Suppliers of the datasets
2. Maintainers of the website (perhaps the most active users!)
3. End-users consuming datasets

#### A few personas of users:
1. Curious about what data is available but no end goal, project or datasets in mind. 
  1. a. Goes to first page and that's it if not interested there.
  1. b. Spends <4 minutes browsing and then bails if nothing in line with interests.
  1. c. Will read details of multiple datasets and maybe download 1 or 2 max.
  1. d. Will read details on every dataset up to first 50 and downloads 4 or 10 to explore in more depth.
2. Geologist with high level of programming skills. Interested in seismic data related to automatic fault picking.

#### Use-cases
1. Geologists new to programming who want to try standard data science packages like Pandas but want to use geoscience data.
2. Geologists new to programming who want to try standard data science packages like Pandas but want to use geoscience data.
3. Geologists new to programming who want to try standard data science packages like Pandas but want to use geoscience data.
4. Geologists new to programming who want to try standard data science packages like Pandas but want to use geoscience data.
